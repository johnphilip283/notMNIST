# notMNIST
A series of networks used to classify the notMNIST dataset, popularized by Yaroslav Bulatov, who works on Tensorflow at Google.

These networks take in a series of training images, which are the letters A - Z. However, all of them are stylized in some
wacky fashion, or are in different fonts, or any mixture of the two, making the task of classification much harder than 
that regarding the standard MNIST dataset. This project is my first attempt at getting familiar with TensorFlow and best practices in the field 
when it comes to CNN and DNN engineering,
